A Ruby SWIG binding for GLEW (supporting GLEW 1.5.1 at present)

The latest version of GLEW is 1.5.3, but there's only 1.5.1 in Ubuntu repos, that's why this uses 1.5.1 too.

= Installation

  sudo apt-get install libglew1.5
  sudo gem install glew

= Usage

  require 'opengl'
  require 'glew'
  Glew.methods # a long list here
